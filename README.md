# Five Card Draw Poker (CLI)

This is my first real Python project: a terminal-based **Five Card Draw Poker game**. Itâ€™s part of my personal journey into full-time software development and machine learning.

This repo is being used to:
- Learn Python (object-oriented programming, functions, file structure)
- Practice Git and GitHub workflows
- Build a portfolio of hands-on projects
- Simulate a real freelance dev process from start to finish

## What's Working So Far

- [x] Created and tested `Deck` class
- [x] Generated a 52-card deck using list comprehension
- [x] Shuffle functionality added
- [x] Deal method implemented and tested
- [x] First commit and push to GitHub from terminal
- [x] Environment fully configured on Pop!_OS

## How to Run It

```bash
python3 deck.py
