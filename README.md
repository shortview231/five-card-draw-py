# ‚ô†Ô∏è Five Card Draw Poker (Python Edition)

Welcome to **Five Card Draw**, a terminal + GUI-based poker game built entirely in Python from scratch.  
This project is part of a larger portfolio to demonstrate OOP mastery, data handling, and GUI design.

---

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a fully playable CLI poker game modeled after classic **Five Card Draw** rules, now entering GUI development using **Tkinter**.

Built 100% modular with a focus on:
- Clean object-oriented design
- User-friendly gameplay
- Expandable features (GUI, AI betting logic, multiplayer, etc.)

---

## ‚úÖ Current Features (Completed)

### üß† Core Game Logic:
- Full game loop: betting, discarding, drawing, and showdown
- OOP design with `Player`, `Deck`, and `Game` classes
- Basic CPU logic for betting & folding
- Hand evaluation system (`poker.py`) with ranking from High Card to Royal Flush
- Game loops automatically into new rounds

### üñ•Ô∏è CLI Game:
- Fully playable in the terminal
- Includes card handling, betting, and win detection

### üß© GUI Progress:
- Main Menu screen (Tkinter)
- Green poker felt background
- Royal Flush placeholder title
- Start Game popup with:
  - Name input
  - Player count selection (2‚Äì4 players)
- Buttons for "Start Game", "Rules", and "Exit"
- Modular GUI setup with reusable styles in `gui_units.py`

---

## üõ†Ô∏è To Do (Next Phases)

### Phase 2: GUI Game Window
- Build the game screen for displaying player hands
- Highlight/select cards to discard (keyboard support)
- Add betting and game flow with GUI buttons
- Handle win logic and reset in GUI

### Phase 3: Visual Polish
- Custom card visuals or font-based rendering
- Card animations (optional)
- Sound effects (chip sounds, win effects, etc.)

### Phase 4: Final Touches
- Responsive resolution scaling
- Final README polish with media
- Optional: Create an executable `.exe` or `.app` for easy sharing

# üé¥ Five Card Draw Poker ‚Äì Game GUI

This section of the project handles the full graphical interface for the **Five Card Draw Poker** game. It uses `tkinter` and `Pillow` to render card images, position players around a virtual poker table, and scale/rotate cards for a visually immersive layout.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è What This GUI Does

- Displays a full poker table layout with 2‚Äì4 players
- Shows 5-card hands for each player
- Rotates CPU player cards to simulate table angles
- Scales card sizes (player hand is larger, CPUs are smaller)
- Includes vertical name labels for CPU2 (left) and CPU3 (right)
- Displays player name and welcome message

---

## üß† Technical Features

- **Card Rendering**: Cards are dynamically loaded from image files, scaled, and rotated using `Pillow` (`ImageTk`).
- **Player Positioning**:
  - `CPU 1` at top center
  - `CPU 2` left (cards vertical, name aligned vertically)
  - `CPU 3` right (cards vertical, name aligned vertically)
  - `PLAYER` at bottom center (larger hand, full-size)
- **Card Assets**:
  - Based on the [`kenney_playing-cards-pack`](https://kenney.nl/assets/playing-cards)
  - Uses "large" image variant by default
- **Responsive Layout**: GUI adapts based on player count and keeps all elements on screen within a `1280x720` window
