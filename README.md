# ‚ô†Ô∏è Five Card Draw Poker (Python Edition)

Welcome to **Five Card Draw**, a terminal + GUI-based poker game built entirely in Python from scratch.  
This project is part of a larger portfolio to demonstrate OOP mastery, data handling, and GUI design.

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a fully playable CLI poker game modeled after classic **Five Card Draw** rules, now entering GUI development using **Tkinter**.

Built 100% modular with a focus on:
- Clean object-oriented design
- User-friendly gameplay
- Expandable features (GUI, AI betting logic, multiplayer, etc.)

- Full game loop: betting, discarding, drawing, and showdown
- OOP design with `Player`, `Deck`, and `Game` classes

- Card animations (optional)
- Sound effects (chip sounds, win effects, etc.)

### Phase 4: Final Touches
- Responsive resolution scaling
- Final README polish with media
- Optional: Create an executable `.exe` or `.app` for easy sharing
