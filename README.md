# Five Card Draw (Python CLI)

This is my first major Python project — a command-line implementation of the classic card game **Five Card Draw**. The project is modular and designed for scalability and learning, combining core Python skills with version control and good coding practices.

---

## Current Modules

### ✅ `deck.py`
- Creates and shuffles a standard 52-card deck
- Supports dealing any number of cards from the deck

### ✅ `poker.py`
- Evaluates poker hands (Pair, Two Pair, Three of a Kind, etc.)
- Includes logic for scoring and tiebreaking between hands
- Supports Royal Flush, Straight Flush, and low-Ace logic
- Returns both a string label and numeric score for comparisons

---

## Goals of This Project
- Strengthen understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Build modular, testable Python scripts
- Learn **Git & GitHub** version control workflow
- Prepare for future additions like player management, betting, and UI

---

## Upcoming
- `player.py`: Player objects with chip counts, hands, and actions
- `main.py`: Full playable Five Card Draw loop with betting and turns
- Later: Possible GUI with Tkinter or integration into a web app

---

## Notes
- This project is being tracked and updated via Git and GitHub.
- The code is for educational purposes but aims for real-world structure.
